As a result of the settlement, the Waxman Landfill property was to be managed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which agreed to assume responsibility for the landfill closure. In early 1991, the USDA began the final stage of capping the landfill, bringing in clay soils to create a "cap" on the property.

Pines Road (on the east), Bartle Road (to the north) and East Pleasant Avenue (on the west), provide the landfill with a rectangular border. The property rises to a height of 150 feet (46 m), in stark contrast to the elevation in the surrounding area which is only 20 to 30 feet (6.1 to 9.1 m) above sea level.

The Waxman Superfund Site has been the subject of several lawsuits regarding the nature and adequacy of the closure and monitoring. Many of these concerns stemmed from the fact that the elevation of the landfill is higher than the 100-year flood plain, with adjacent, downstream wetlands sloping at very shallow grades. Landfill closures are rarely without controversy, but the Waxman Landfill is the subject of particular anxiety due to its designation as a Superfund site. Methane gas can be found in the landfill (a common occurrence when organic matter decomposes) and has been the subject of several questions regarding the closure.

Despite a multimillion-dollar cleanup involving federal and state environmental agencies, and numerous environmental studies, the effect of the methane, leachate from the waste materials, or water runoff has not been conclusively determined.

In 2002, the USDA decided to divest itself of the Waxman Landfill since it was unable to sell it to a private individual or to the Township. By an act of the U.S. Congress, the landfill was transferred to the Secretary of the Interior to be managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the adjacent Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge.

Today, the landfill is only noticeable as an abrupt mound rising from the wetlands; it has been covered with grass and shrubs that form a meadow habitat, which provides nesting habitat for a variety of birds, including the bobolink and eastern meadowlark.

==Wildlife refuge==
[[File:Wallkill River NWR - Logo.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge logo, 2023]]
The Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge comprises almost 6,000 acres (9.4 sq mi) along a 12-mile (19 km) stretch of the river, from Vernon Township in the Highlands of northern New Jersey to near the New York state line in Sussex Borough, and into Orange County, New York. The refuge exists primarily to support and protect wetlands in the Wallkill River's watershed to provide habitat for migratory birds. The refuge is home to 40 species of mammals, and over 200 bird species have been observed within its boundaries. The refuge includes large areas of "muck farms"—where early settlers drained the river's valley wetlands for agricultural purposes. Due to the high fertility of these fields, they have very high value for agricultural uses, and have been extensively farmed. Restoration of these drained areas to their natural state as wetlands is a goal of the refuge.

In 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service established the national wildlife refuge with the acquisition of Columbia Wildlife Management Area from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection—a  state agency. The refuge lies in the heart of the Highlands Region of New Jersey, and includes portions of the Wallkill's watershed in both New Jersey and New York.

According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the refuge supports 24 federal trust species—including the federally threatened bog turtle—wintering raptors such as the short-eared owl, and waterfowl species. It protects 13 state-listed endangered or threatened species, and provides 4,000 acres (6.3 sq mi) of quality wetland habitats for migratory birds. The refuge is located within an hour's drive of New York City.

Most of the Wallkill River watershed is rural or agricultural. Agricultural uses include dairy farming, growing [[corn]], [[Hay|hay]], [[sod]], [[soybean]]s, [[vegetables]], [[apple]] orchards, and [[Horse breeding|horse breeding]]. Rural residential communities make up most of the developed land in the basin. The Wallkill River's watershed (in combination with the Rondout Creek) makes up 15.6% of the Hudson River basin, and occupies 1.2% of the land area in [[New York (state)|New York State]].

The [[karst]] topography of the Wallkill watershed creates sinkholes, which allow surface water to directly reach groundwater. Since water that ends up in sinkholes bypasses the natural filtration that normally takes place in [[Aquifer|the subsurface]], contamination is a significant concern. In agricultural areas, livestock waste and fertilizers can contaminate groundwater if not properly contained and managed.

Underground water from the Wallkill basin is calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate ("hard") water, which is typical of carbonate rock aquifers. Due to its agricultural nature, surface and groundwater in the Wallkill River basin are high in nutrients, especially nitrates. However, an aquifer south of [[Montgomery (town), New York|Montgomery, New York]] has higher quality water due to a lack of carbonate rock.

==Agriculture==
The region known as the Black Dirt Region, located in southern [[Orange County, New York|Orange County, New York]] in the towns of [[Warwick, New York|Warwick]], [[Wawayanda, New York|Wawayanda]], and [[Minisink, New York|Minisink]], and northern [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County, New Jersey]], derived its name from the deep, [[humus|humic]] [[alluvium|alluvial]] [[soil]]—the result of [[Pleistocene|Ice age]] flooding of an ancient glacial lake, known as [[Lake Wallkill]]. The area was essentially uninhabited before European settlement, as local indigenous [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] and [[Algonquian peoples]] avoided the muddy swamp that dominated the region. Later, white settlers drained the swamp for use as highly fertile farmland. Farmers of Polish, German and Dutch descent have farmed the region for more than 300 years. The towns of [[Pine Island, New York|Pine Island]] and [[Florida, Orange County, New York|Florida, New York]], and Sussex Borough in New Jersey are located within the Black Dirt Region.

The Black Dirt region has 26,000 acres (41 sq mi) of the most fertile soil in the country, consisting of the highest content of decayed [[vegetation]] and [[humus]] of any soil in the U.S. outside the [[Everglades]] of [[Florida]]. The soil has been drained, and the rivers channelized. The region is bordered by the [[Wallkill River]] and Pochuck Creek. The creek, which runs in a northeasterly path joining the Wallkill in Campbell Hall, New York, is in places a partly channelized offshoot of the river or other [[tributary (stream)|creeks]] feeding into the river.

===Origins===
The muck soil of the Black Dirt Region developed from the bottom of a 9,000-acre (14 sq mi) lake that formed when a glacier melted 12,000 years ago. This created an extensive flooded area. The muddy bottom of the former lake was covered with shallow water and reeds, attracting numerous [[bird]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[muskrat]]s, [[brontochelys|and bullfrogs]]. The soil is so dark that it looks as though it has been saturated with [[motor oil]].

===Future of the Black Dirt Region===
The Black Dirt region is experiencing development pressure, which has led to residential and commercial building replacing agriculture. A large mall has been built on former Black Dirt land, right at the base of the Appalachian Trail at Vernon, New Jersey. The mall is home to a large [[Woodbury Common|Woodbury Common Premium Outlets]] center. Several groups have started initiatives to save the Black Dirt Region. Land trusts have been formed, most notably, the Orange County Land Trust and Agricultural Stewardship Association.

===Alfalfa and corn—the new cash crops===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2022}}

Local dairy farms have been expanding each year, buying more land for [[alfalfa]] and [[corn]] [[animal feed]]. These farms sell their milk to regional dairy concerns like Dairylea, which serve densely populated areas.

===Onions—the traditional cash crop===
[[File:Onions - Waxman.jpg|thumb|right|Onions at the former Waxman farm, Vernon Township, 2009]]
Farmers in the Wallkill's Black Dirt Region predominantly grow [[onion]]s. The region's specific variety, known in the onion industry as "Yankee Yellow", "New York Bold", and "New York Yellow Globe", are known for their [[pungent]] culinary qualities.

Many of the farmers in the Black Dirt Region are the third, fourth, or fifth generation of onion farmers on the same land. Because the black dirt has extremely poor [[drainage]], many fields are surrounded by drainage [[ditch]]es. The 1994 growing season was very good for Orange County onion growers. A total of 5,130 acres (8.0 sq mi) of onions was harvested in Orange County in 1994, with a market value of $42.5 million, second among the state's 62 counties. Orange County, New York is the largest onion-producing county in the northeastern United States, with [[Cornell University]] having an onion-[[Agricultural extension|extension]] office in Orange County.

The Wallkill River ({{IPAc-en|'|w|ɔː|l|k|ɪ|l}}; -kill meaning "riverbed" or "stream" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a tributary of the [[Hudson River]] that flows from the northwest corner of [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County, New Jersey]], and runs west through Orange County, New York, returning to New Jersey to flow southeast into the [[Paulinskill|Pochuck River]] and finally the Hudson.

==Geography==
{{Main article|Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge}}
The river has a [[watershed]] of 785 square miles (2,030 km<sup>2</sup>) and includes the [[Papakating Creek]], [[Pochuck Creek]], [[Rutgers Creek]], [[Wawayanda Creek]], Sawmill Creek, [[Woodbury Creek (Orange County, New York)|Woodbury Creek]] and [[Shawangunk Kill]]. Most of the watershed is dedicated to agriculture, and there is also a large amount of protected land within the watershed. It is one of the larger rivers in the [[Hudson River watershed]].

==Course==
[[File:Headwaters of the Wallkill River.jpg|thumb|left|The headwaters of the Wallkill River from Lake Mohawk, at Sparta, 2009]]

The Wallkill River flows north from its source in [[Lake Mohawk]], a lake in [[Sparta, New Jersey|Sparta Township]], New Jersey. From there it flows through a valley within the [[Appalachian Mountains]], generally in a northeasterly direction. After flowing through the [[Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge]] and leaving Sussex County, New Jersey, it enters [[Orange County, New York]]. It flows through the town of [[Warwick, New York|Warwick, New York]], then through the towns of [[Minisink, New York|Minisink]], [[Wawayanda, New York|Wawayanda]], [[Goshen, New York|Goshen]], [[Wallkill, New York|Wallkill]], [[Montgomery, New York|Montgomery]], and [[Newburgh]], before flowing into [[Ulster County, New York]], where it works its way through the towns of [[Gardiner, New York|Gardiner]], [[Rosendale, New York|Rosendale]], [[Esopus, New York|Esopus]], [[Ulster, New York|Ulster]], and [[New Paltz, New York|New Paltz]].

At the [[Ulster County|Ulster County]]/[[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] border, the river flows through the [[Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge]]. The refuge was established to protect the [[wetland]]s of the Wallkill River and its associated wildlife. [[New York State Route 213]] crosses the river at [[Tillson, New York|Tillson]]. At [[New Paltz, New York|New Paltz]], the river is crossed by [[Historic Huguenot Street]], considered by some to be the oldest street in America with its original houses. The street was settled by Huguenots who arrived from present-day northern Germany and the Netherlands circa 1678-80. These settlers built what are considered to be the oldest continually inhabited street with stone houses in the United States.

The river continues north to [[Sturgeon Pool]] just south of Rifton, and then to the [[Eddyville Bridge]] where [[New York State Route 213]] crosses again. Just south of [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]], at [[Rondout Creek#The Hamlet of Rondout|Rondout Creek]], it empties into the [[Hudson River]].

==History==
{{Original research section|date=October 2022}}

In the last years of the American Revolution, [[George Washington]] spent time in the Newburgh/New Windsor area. The construction of a chain across the Hudson River from the area of Constitution Island to the east shore at [[West Point, New York|West Point]] was as a strategic decision to prevent [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] ships from sailing upriver. Some of the chain links are displayed on Trophy Point at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], with the remainder left at the bottom of the river. The chain was hauled from [[Sterling Forest]].

Robert Fulton's steam sailing vessel, the [[Clermont (1807 steamboat)|Clermont]], came through the area in 1807.

===Industrial Revolution===
With the Delaware and [[Hudson Canal]], which ran alongside the Wallkill through Montgomery and Ulster, the Wallkill played an important part in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The D & H Canal carried [[coal]] from [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]] and [[Honesdale, Pennsylvania|Honesdale]], [[Pennsylvania]] over the Moosic Mountains and down to the Hudson River and on to [[New York City]].

[[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Ulster Counties]] were vacation spots for the wealthy from New York City for the first half of the 20th century. The [[Mohonk Mountain House]], Minnewaska Hotel, and Mohawk Hotel were just a few of the grand hotels. The [[Playhouse Theater in New Paltz]], [[New York]] showed local productions and Broadway plays.

===Wallkill River "Sea Monster"===
{{main|Wallkill River monster}}
In August 1984, a group of teenagers were riding a paddleboat when they encountered what they described as a 20-foot (6.1 m)-long [[serpent]]-like creature with a head like a [[dog]]. The local police chief reported that by the end of the summer month the police had received more than 50 reports from [[panicked]] citizens about an "alligator-like" creature lurking in the water.

===Central New Jersey bridge collapse===
{{main|Central Railroad of New Jersey's Wanaque River Bridge]]The [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]'s [[Sussex Branch]] crossed the river at [[Sussex (borough), New Jersey|Sussex, New Jersey]], on a high wooden trestle heading toward [[Balesville, New Jersey|Balesville]] and [[Newton, New Jersey|Newton, New Jersey]]. When the [[Lake Mohawk|Tohokone]] dam burst, the trestle was washed away. A diesel and 20 cars were destroyed August 4, 1955. The railroad line had to be abandoned since the cost of rebuilding the bridge was not justified; the railroad was given permission to abandon the line by the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].

===Waxman Superfund site===
For several years beginning in 1991, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]], removed 140,000 cubic yards (110,000 m<sup>3</sup>) of soil from the river at a cost of $6.5 million in order to make the [[wetland]]s and the river sustainable, as well as to provide a habitat for [[endangered]]  [[Animal|species]]. 12,700 acres (20 sq mi) of wildlife habitat have been created, the river has been [[contaminant|decontaminated]], and [[Flood|flooding]] has been drastically reduced.

Following decades of pollution, the Wallkill River was added to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[List of Superfund sites|Superfund]] listing. The area of greatest concern was a four-mile (6 km) section of the river in Hardyston Township, in the area of [[Vernon Township, New Jersey|Vernon Township]], [[Sussex, New Jersey|Sussex]], and [[Franklin, Sussex County, New Jersey|Franklin, New Jersey]].

A landfill operated there for 11 years, filled with waste primarily from the textile industry, as well as waste oils contaminated with [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCBs), and [[sludge]] contaminated with heavy [[metal]]s. The landfill was listed as a [[Superfund]] site in 1983, and was capped in 1997. Dupont operated a pigment manufacturing facility from the 1940s to the 1960s, including waste disposal, on an adjacent site, which the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) considered to be contributing to the "plume" emanating from the landfill. Extensive cleanup of the landfill site and the pigment manufacturing facility was conducted under the auspices of the Superfund program.

The "Waxman Chemical" [[Superfund site]]—operated by Sam Waxman from 1962 to 1979—had previously been known by several names: Waxman Chemical, VCA/Polygrass Superfund Site, Polygrass Site, and Vanderbilt Chemical [[landfill]]. Waxman Chemical had been located within a 10-acre (40,000 m<sup>2</sup>) plot on the Sussex Branch of the Erie [[Lackawanna Railroad]], just above the Wallkill River. Waxman operated what was described as a "liquid disposal/recovery" or "waste oil recovery" business on the property. The chemical industry and the town were unable to coordinate efforts to resolve the severe [[environmental damage]] caused by the landfill, but in 1988, the EPA ordered the parties responsible for dumping to pay for the cleanup. This resulted in a [[lawsuit]] involving 130 parties including chemical industries, landowners, and the federal government.

As a result of the settlement, the Waxman Landfill property was to be managed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which agreed to assume responsibility for the landfill closure. In early 1991, the USDA began the final stage of capping the landfill, bringing in clay soils to create a "cap" on the property.

Pines Road (on the east), Bartle Road (to the north) and East Pleasant Avenue (on the west), provide the landfill with a rectangular border. The property rises to a height of 150 feet (46 m), in stark contrast to the elevation in the surrounding area which is only 20 to 30 feet (6.1 to 9.1 m) above sea level.

The Waxman Superfund Site has been the subject of several lawsuits regarding the nature and adequacy of the closure and monitoring. Many of these concerns stemmed from the fact that the elevation of the landfill is higher than the 100-year flood plain, with adjacent, downstream wetlands sloping at very shallow grades.

Methane gas can be found in the landfill (a common occurrence when organic matter decomposes) and has been the subject of several questions regarding the closure.

Despite a multimillion-dollar cleanup involving federal and state environmental agencies, and numerous environmental studies, the effect of the methane, leachate from the waste materials, or water runoff has not been conclusively determined.

The region known as the Black Dirt Region, located in southern [[Orange County, New York|Orange County, New York]] in the towns of [[Warwick, New York|Warwick]], [[Wawayanda, New York|Wawayanda]], and [[Minisink, New York|Minisink]], and northern [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County, New Jersey]], derived its name from the deep, [[humus|humic]] [[alluvium|alluvial]] [[soil]]—the result of [[Pleistocene|Ice age]] flooding of an ancient glacial lake, known as [[Lake Wallkill]]. The area was essentially uninhabited before European settlement, as local indigenous [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] and [[Algonquian peoples]] avoided the muddy swamp that dominated the region. Later, white settlers drained the swamp for use as highly fertile farmland. Farmers of Polish, German and Dutch descent have farmed the region for more than 300 years. The towns of [[Pine Island, New York|Pine Island]] and [[Florida, Orange County, New York|Florida, New York]], and Sussex Borough in New Jersey are located within the Black Dirt Region.

The Black Dirt region has 26,000 acres (41 sq mi) of the most fertile soil in the country, consisting of the highest content of decayed [[vegetation]] and [[humus]] of any soil in the U.S. outside the [[Everglades]] of [[Florida]]. The soil has been drained, and the rivers channelized. The region is bordered by the [[Wallkill River]] and Pochuck Creek. The creek, which runs in a northeasterly path joining the Wallkill in Campbell Hall, New York, is in places a partly channelized offshoot of the river or other [[tributary (stream)|creeks]] feeding into the river.

===Origins===
The muck soil of the Black Dirt Region developed from the bottom of a 9,000-acre (14 sq mi) lake that formed when a glacier melted 12,000 years ago. This created an extensive flooded area. The muddy bottom of the former lake was covered with shallow water and reeds, attracting numerous [[bird]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[muskrat]]s, [[brontochelys|and bullfrogs]]. The soil is so dark that it looks as though it has been saturated with [[motor oil]].

===Future of the Black Dirt Region===
The Black Dirt region is experiencing development pressure, which has led to residential and commercial building replacing agriculture. A large mall has been built on former Black Dirt land, right at the base of the Appalachian Trail at Vernon, New Jersey. The mall is home to a large [[Woodbury Common|Woodbury Common Premium Outlets]] center. Several groups have started initiatives to save the Black Dirt Region. Land trusts have been formed, most notably, the Orange County Land Trust and Agricultural Stewardship Association.

===Alfalfa and corn—the new cash crops===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2022}}

Local dairy farms have been expanding each year, buying more land for [[alfalfa]] and [[corn]] [[animal feed]]. These farms sell their milk to regional dairy concerns like Dairylea, which serve densely populated areas.

===Onions—the traditional cash crop===

Farmers in the Wallkill's Black Dirt Region predominantly grow [[onion]]s. The region's specific variety, known in the onion industry as "Yankee Yellow", "New York Bold", and "New York Yellow Globe", are known for their [[pungent]] culinary qualities.

Many of the farmers in the Black Dirt Region are the third, fourth, or fifth generation of onion farmers on the same land. Because the black dirt has extremely poor [[drainage]], many fields are surrounded by drainage [[ditch]]es. The 1994 growing season was very good for Orange County onion growers. A total of 5,130 acres (8.0 sq mi) of onions was harvested in Orange County in 1994, with a market value of $42.5 million, second among the state's 62 counties. Orange County, New York is the largest onion-producing county in the northeastern United States, with [[Cornell University]] having an onion-[[Agricultural extension|extension]] office in Orange County.
